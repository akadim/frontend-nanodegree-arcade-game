## Instructions

 To launch the game simply open the `index.html` file and move the Player using the directional keys of the keyboard.\
 The game's assets are stored in 3 folders : 
   - The `css` folder which contains the styles of the game
   - The `images` folders which contains the sprites
   - The `js` folder which contain the game engine and its mechanics 
   - The rules of the game are written inside the `app.js` using the Object Oriented Approach
